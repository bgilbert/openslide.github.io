Format
: single-file pyramidal tiled TIFF

File extensions
: `.tif`

OpenSlide vendor backend
: `generic-tiff`


## Detection

OpenSlide will detect a file as generic TIFF if:

 1. No other detections succeed.
 2. The file is TIFF.
 3. The initial image is tiled.


## TIFF Image Directory Organization

The first image in the TIFF file is the full-resolution image. Any
other tiled images in the file with the "reduced resolution" bit set
are assumed to be reduced-resolution versions of the original.


## Associated Images

None.


## Known Properties

Many TIFF tags are encoded as properties starting with "`tiff.`".
