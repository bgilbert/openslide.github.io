For now, the main developer documentation is the
[Adding a New Format][doc-newformat] page.  Take particular note of the
section on error handling, but the entire page is worth reading.

The [other developer docs][doc-dev] may also be useful.


## Release process

We have issue templates for each type of release.  OpenSlide maintainers can
perform a release by filing a new issue named after the new version to be
released, and checking boxes.
