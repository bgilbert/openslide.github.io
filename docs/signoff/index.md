title: Signing Off on Changes to OpenSlide
---

{% include links.md %}

All contributions to the OpenSlide project are made under the [GNU Lesser
General Public License, version 2.1][license].  Before contributing, you
must ensure that you have the right to submit your change under that
license.  For example, you may _not_ have that right if:

- **your employer owns the copyright to your change** and has not given you
  permission to contribute it, or
- you developed the change using documentation (or other information)
  obtained under a **non-disclosure agreement** or a **restrictive license**
  that forbids using it to develop open-source software.

**Each time you contribute, you must affirm that you have the right
to do so** by signing off on the [Developer Certificate of Origin, version
1.1](#developer-certificate-of-origin).
To do that, add a line to the bottom of your commit messages:

    Signed-off-by: Harry Q. Bovik <bovik@cs.cmu.edu>

using your real name and email address.  Git will add this line
automatically if you use `git commit -s`.
