title: Adding a New Slide Format to OpenSlide
---

{% include links.md %}

To add a new format to OpenSlide, you will need to write a new vendor
driver.  When a slide is opened, the driver is responsible for parsing the
slide file, loading its metadata, and locating its image tiles.  At runtime,
the driver receives requests for pixel data, determines which tiles to load,
decodes them to a buffer in a
[Cairo-compatible pixel format](https://cairographics.org/manual/cairo-Image-Surfaces.html#cairo-format-t),
and renders them to a [Cairo](https://cairographics.org/) surface.

Your driver can use the *grid* module to map pixel coordinates to tile
addresses:

- The `simple` grid is suitable for slide formats that have non-overlapping,
  regularly-spaced, equal-sized tiles, and do not need to record individual
  information about each tile.  (TIFF images often have this property.)

- The `tilemap` grid is suitable for formats in which each tile is assigned
  a row and column on a regular grid, but the tiles may be offset from their
  ideal positions on the grid, overlapping, irregular, or sparse.  (Formats
  that directly store the pixels recorded from each camera position, as the
  camera steps over the slide, often have this property.)

- The `range` grid is suitable for formats with arbitrarily-placed tiles.

Your driver should use the *cache* module to cache pixel data from decoded
tiles.  This prevents unnecessary decode operations if a region is accessed
repeatedly.

OpenSlide contains support code for reading BMP, JPEG, JPEG 2000, PNG, TIFF,
and TIFF-like images.  You may be able to use these utilities without
modification.  If your driver requires additional decoding functionality, it
should be added to a decoder module if it would be useful to other drivers,
or implemented in your driver if not.

At runtime, your driver can receive concurrent read requests from multiple
threads.  Most drivers can handle this locklessly by fully initializing
their data structures at open time (when they have exclusive access to the
`openslide_t`) and then treating them as immutable at runtime.  This
approach requires that every read request operates on private (or
thread-safe) instances of any necessary system resources, such as file
handles.

Drivers are named after the vendor of the product that uses the format.
This is often the manufacturer of the slide scanner.

For examples, consult the existing vendor drivers.  `generic-tiff` is a
straightforward driver for simple TIFF images.  `trestle` is a fairly simple
driver using the `tilemap` grid.


## Opening a slide

Opening a slide occurs in two steps, implemented via function pointers in
`struct _openslide_format`.

- The `detect` method should do some inexpensive tests to verify that the
  specified file is supported by your driver.  If `detect` fails, OpenSlide
  will continue trying other format drivers.  If the `OPENSLIDE_DEBUG`
  environment variable is set to `detection`, OpenSlide will use
  `g_message()` to log the error message returned by `detect`.

- The `open` method initializes the `openslide_t` with the information that
  will be needed at runtime.  `open` will never be called unless `detect`
  has succeeded.  If `open` fails, OpenSlide will consider this a hard
  failure, and `openslide_open()` will return a `openslide_t` in error
  state.  This can occur if the file appears to be a slide that should be
  supported by your driver, but is not structured in the expected way.
  (Perhaps the slide uses a variant of the format that the driver does not
  yet support.)


## TIFF and TIFF-like

OpenSlide has two decoders for TIFF-derived slide formats: `tiff` and
`tifflike`.

- `tiff` uses libtiff to read the slide file.  Most drivers for TIFF-based
  formats use this decoder.  libtiff can parse TIFF directories, decode image
  data in compression formats described in the TIFF specification, and return
  compressed image data for all other compression formats.  Because libtiff
  has a deep understanding of the TIFF tag values, it will reject files that
  use the TIFF directory structure but make creative use of the standard tags.
  Since libtiff handles are not safe for concurrent access by multiple
  threads, the `tiff` decoder provides a cache of libtiff handles that can be
  acquired for exclusive use by a thread while it is servicing a read request.

- `tifflike` is a TIFF directory parser built into OpenSlide.  It does not
  understand tag values and cannot decode compressed image data; it simply
  reads the TIFF directories and reports on what they contain.  This decoder
  can be used for formats that use the standard TIFF tags in unusual ways.

All `detect` and `open` methods receive a `tifflike` handle as an argument;
this will be NULL if the file does not appear to be a TIFF.  Because
`detect` should be inexpensive, it should do its work using that `tifflike`
handle, and should not use the `tiff` decoder.  `open`, however, can use the
`tiff` decoder if desired.  Note that OpenSlide will close the `tifflike`
handle when the `open` method completes, so the driver should copy any
information it needs out of the `tifflike` handle during `open`.


## Properties

The vendor driver is responsible for initializing a property map containing
metadata about the slide.  A property has a name (a string) and a value
(another string).  Property names defined by your driver should be prefixed
by your driverâ€™s name followed by a dot.  You should create properties for
any and all metadata supported by your slide format.  If the slide format
contains textual metadata formatted as key-value pairs, you may dump this
metadata directly into the property map, retaining the original key names
(after prepending the name of the driver).  If you need to invent your own
key names, you should use `lowercase-with-hyphens` formatting.

Drivers for TIFF-derived formats should also call
`_openslide_tifflike_init_properties_and_hash()` to set some standard
properties pertaining to TIFF files.

Your driver is also responsible for setting some
[standard properties][doc-properties], when they apply to your format:

- `openslide.background-color`
- `openslide.bounds-height` (must be an integer)
- `openslide.bounds-width` (must be an integer)
- `openslide.bounds-x` (must be an integer)
- `openslide.bounds-y` (must be an integer)
- `openslide.comment`
- `openslide.mpp-x` (should be a double)
- `openslide.mpp-y` (should be a double)
- `openslide.objective-power` (should be an integer)
- `openslide.region[i].height` (must be an integer)
- `openslide.region[i].width` (must be an integer)
- `openslide.region[i].x` (must be an integer)
- `openslide.region[i].y` (must be an integer)

`openslide.background-color` should be set with
`_openslide_set_background_color_prop()`.

The `openslide.bounds-*` properties should be set for formats that do not
store image data for every pixel in the level.  Drivers that use a single
`tilemap` or `range` grid per level can set these properties with
`_openslide_set_bounds_props_from_grid()`.

`openslide.mpp-x`, `openslide.mpp-y`, and `openslide.objective-power` should
be a copy of, or otherwise derived from, another vendor-specific property.
The vendor-specific property should be the uninterpreted value from the
slide file, while the `openslide.` property should be the validated or
calculated value, often produced with
`_openslide_duplicate_{int,double}_prop()`.

The `openslide.region[i].*` properties should be set when a format can
include image pyramids for multiple regions of the slide, and its driver
handles this by combining the regions into a single main image.  One group
of dimension properties should be set for each region in the slide file,
even if the slide contains only one region.

You should not set `openslide.quickhash-1` or `openslide.vendor` directly.

For examples of properties produced by existing drivers, see the
[web demo][demo].

### quickhash-1

When opening a slide, OpenSlide calculates a "quickhash-1" which uniquely
identifies that particular slide.  (The quickhash-1 can be accessed via the
`openslide.quickhash-1` property.) It is implemented as a SHA-256 digest of
a small amount of metadata and data from the slide file.  It is *not*
intended as a cryptographic hash over the entire file.

If you call `_openslide_tifflike_init_properties_and_hash()`, that function
will calculate the quickhash-1 for you.  Otherwise, you will need to handle
this calculation yourself.  Your `open` function will receive an
`_openslide_hash` handle; you should use the `_openslide_hash` helper
functions to add the data you wish to include in the quickhash-1.

You should carefully select the data and metadata to be included in the
quickhash.  Once your driver has been included in an OpenSlide release, it
will be difficult or impossible to change the quickhash definition for your
slide format.  The quickhash should not cover too much data, so that it is
quick to calculate, but should never produce the same value for two
different slides.  To accomplish this, it may be sufficient to hash all of
the slide's metadata; if not, you can include the (compressed) image data
from the lowest-resolution pyramid level.


## Associated images

In some slide formats, a slide file includes not only the primary,
high-resolution slide image, but additional ancillary images.  For example,
there might be a thumbnail of the entire slide, or a photograph of its paper
label.  OpenSlide calls these "associated images" and provides an API to
access them.

Where feasible, your driver should provide access to any associated images
stored with the slide.  Each associated image has a short name; existing
names are:

label
: the paper label (or barcode) glued to the slide

macro
: a photograph of the entire slide, possibly extending beyond the edges of the glass

thumbnail
: a low-resolution version of the primary image

Use your judgement in assigning names to the associated images supported by
your slide format.

OpenSlide currently does not support pyramidal associated images; each
associated image is loaded into memory in its entirety.  If an associated
image is pyramidal but is not too large, your driver can simply provide the
highest-resolution level.


## Error handling

OpenSlide takes a conservative approach to error handling.  Where feasible,
a vendor driver should validate any slide metadata it is relying upon.  If
the driver finds evidence that its understanding of the slide format is
incomplete -- for example, required slide metadata is missing, or an
enumerated field has an unknown value -- it should report an error and give
up rather than attempting to muddle onward.

All internal OpenSlide functions report errors using GError.  GError has a
[strict set of rules][gerror-rules] that **must** be followed when producing
or consuming errors.

When the external API glue receives a GError from a handler method, the
`openslide_t` is placed into error state.  No other operations can be
performed on the `openslide_t`.  The GError `message` is made available to
the application via the `openslide_get_error()` API call.

When producing a GError, you may use whatever error domain and code is
appropriate.  If in doubt, use `OPENSLIDE_ERROR_FAILED`.

If you receive a GError from lower-level code and intend to propagate it,
consider whether the error's `message` provides enough context to diagnose
the failure.  If not, you should prefix the error using `g_prefix_error()`
or `g_propagate_prefixed_error()`.

### Slow-path warnings

Sometimes a slide format will include an optional feature that allows a
slide to be processed more efficiently.  Files that do not contain this
feature can still be read, but at a performance penalty.  Similarly, image
decoders may be designed with "fast paths" for common image parameters (for
example, certain chroma subsampling ratios) and fallback paths for others.
If it is impossible to determine from OpenSlide's output whether the
optimized or fallback path is being used -- for example, by looking at a
property value -- the fallback code should emit a warning message so a bug
in the decision-making code does not become a silent failure.

To emit a warning, use `_openslide_performance_warn()` (at open time) or
`_openslide_performance_warn_once()` (at runtime).  Warnings can be enabled
by setting the `OPENSLIDE_DEBUG` environment variable to `performance`.


## OpenSlide limitations

OpenSlide's output is currently
[limited to three color channels plus an alpha channel](https://github.com/openslide/openslide/issues/42),
with a
[maximum of 8 bits per channel](https://github.com/openslide/openslide/issues/41).
These restrictions are partially due to [Cairo](https://cairographics.org/)
limitations, but correcting them would also require changes to the OpenSlide
API.

In addition, OpenSlide currently
[cannot return data from more than one focal plane per slide](https://github.com/openslide/openslide/issues/31).
This would also require API changes to fix.
